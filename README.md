# StatMechOfPartitions
Attempt to develop a statistical mechanics of clustering (i.e. of partitions).

These are but partial transcripts of some old notes themselves being but a product of brainstorming around the idea of developing a statistical mechanical approach to the description of partitions, aka clusterings -as called in ML. 

Statistical Mechanics entails at heart a partition of the configuration space of a system. The description in terms of a density matrix is reminiscent of defining a probability distribution over the block/cluster-size distribution.

Some interesting connection to symmetry groups is suggested.
